Wellcome to Dromation default application. Default means basic kivy application with pre-typed code.
This code contains basic app UI frame, so you don't have to code from begining. There are also kivy and kivymd
demos, that you can use, but this one is focused more on UI "settings". You can change it if you want, but 
main purpouse is to shorten your time of app development.
